  TYPOGRAPHY FROM AROUND THE WORLD

<div id="infobox">
<div id="info">
Typography from Around The World was a Typography for Print assessment item and also my very first printed piece of work. I came across a few hurdles while designing this book, as such it also taught me a lot about how resolution, colours and overall print media works. It was a challenging task, but if I were to do it again, I would definitely be prepared. The things I learned from this project set me up for success as I have since created a 76 page Marina magazine.
