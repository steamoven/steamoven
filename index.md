# Who?

Hi! My name is Natalia. I'm a graphic designer and sessional academic at Griffith University. My passion is design and I'm always seeking a challenge. I also specialise in vector illustration as I love to include my own flare in design when possible!

I am proficient Adobe Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop. I am currently mainly on corporate branding and product packaging design. I always look for new things to learn, so my list will be ever expanding in the years to come. Please make yourself at home and feel free to contact me!
