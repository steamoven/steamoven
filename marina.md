# Marina Magazine

As part of my Industry Practice course at Griffith University, I was to find an external company to complete a one-hundred hour internship at. 

As well as having completed the assessment with a previous internship, I was intrigued with working at a company that's out of my comfort zone, so I applied when the expression of interest popped up to work at a Marina. A crucial part of my internship was to work alongside a marketing manager to design their annual "Marina" magazine. In just over two months, we managed to complete and send out a 76 page magazine to print. There were 5,000 copies printed in total to be given out all over Australia, as well as internationally. 

After completion I received paid work from Gold Coast City Marina to brand "Quarterdeck", their on-site restaurant. Ialso went on to design a range of advertisements for the Marina (including product packaging design).
